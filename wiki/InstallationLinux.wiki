*Note:* If the shortcut fails to launch the application, this may indicate that one of the dependencies has not been installed correctly, or it is of the wrong version.

== Source package installation ==

 # Ensure that you have Python, PyGTK, GTK+ and setuptools installed
 # Download and extract the source package (the .tar.gz file).
 # Open up a terminal and navigate to the extracted directory.
 # Run the command `python setup.py install` with super-user priveledges (i.e. use su or sudo)
 # A shortcut can be found in your Application menu in the "Other" category. Alternatively the program can be started with the command `lorem-ipsum-generator`.

*Note:* If the shortcut fails to launch the application, this may indicate that one of the dependencies has not been installed correctly, or it is of the wrong version.

== Source package, without installing ==

 # Ensure that you have Python, PyGTK, GTK+ and setuptools installed
 # Download and extract the source package (the .tar.gz file).
 # Locate the `lorem-ipsum-generator` executable under the `src/` directory of the extracted directory.
 # Ensure that the `lorem-ipsum-generator` file is executable (`chmod +x lorem-ipsum-generator`), and then run it
